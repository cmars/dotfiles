# dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. There are many like them, but these dotfiles are mine.

My dotfiles are my best friend. They are my life. I must master them as I must
master my life.

My dotfiles, without me, are useless. Without my dotfiles, on a remote instance
or new laptop, I am useless.

# Install

## Check out & run setup with git

1. Clone this repo as $HOME/dotfiles
2. `$HOME/dotfiles/setup.bash`

## Bootstrap it with curl

```
$ curl -L -O https://goo.gl/jOwuGK
# TODO: check sha256 or gpg signature here...
$ bash jOwuGK
```
