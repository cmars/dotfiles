# dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. There are many like them, but these dotfiles are mine.

My dotfiles are my best friend. They are my life. I must master them as I must
master my life.

My dotfiles, without me, are useless. Without my dotfiles, on a remote
instance, I am useless. I must provision and source my dotfiles true.
